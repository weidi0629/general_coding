-- CTS 
  - Common Type System 
  - describes all possible data types and all programming constructs supported by runtime 
  
-- CLS 
  - Common Language Specification 
  - all .NET programming language can agree on 
 
# The Role of the Base Class Libraries  

-- Overniew of .NET Assemblies 
  - platform-agnostic 系统-不可知
  - 把所有的都转换为 Intermediate Language (IL, CIL )
  - *.dll *.exe is termed as assembly 
  - assembly contain CIL code 
  - meta data: describes in vivid detail of every type in binary 
  - manifest: describe the info of the assemblies 
  
-- The Role of the Common Intermediate Language 
  - vc vb ..不同的language， 如果想通的方程，最后CIL 编译成相同的输出
