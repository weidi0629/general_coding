-- good at working on disk or secondary strorage devices. 
  - minimize disk IO 
  
-- Data structures on secondary storage

-- The B-tree algorithms copy selected pages from disk into main memory as needed and write back onto disk the pages that have changed.


-- 18.1 Definition of B-trees 
  - each node
    - x.n, # of keys stored in the node 
    - n+1 pointer c1..cn+1 point to childern 
    - 上面的key 是subtree的分割
    - all leaves have the same depth 
    - t>=2 minimum degree
    - h <= logt(n+1)/2  n key, t minimun degree 
      - 因为是logt, 所以数是胖矮行的，avoid a substantial number of disk accesses.
