算法导论： 
-- subproblems share subsubproblems
-- general 4 steps
  - 1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.  -- dp[i][j]代表什么 
  - 2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution. -- 跟sub-problem的关系 
  - 3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
-- optimal substructure: 
  - optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to related subproblems, which we may solve independently.
-- time-memory trade-off: as long as distinct problem is in ploynomial size
